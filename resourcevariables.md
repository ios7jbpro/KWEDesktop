# Resource Variables
This section explains what each variable does under the "resource" folder.

[bg]

This resource variable is used to be called from other widgets, for easier progression rather than re-coding it to every single widget. It's a code to pull the sysflag "darkTh", and then change the variable state according to the sysflag "darkTh" variable.

[bgvbrnt]

Same thing as above. Only exception is that it's made for a more vibrant color instead, so sub-elements can stand out.

[width]

Used to pull the device screen size width, to resize widgets easier.

[height]

Same thing as above for height of the screen.

[textc]

Same thing as [bg] and [bgvbrnt] but for text widgets instead.
